- When making a new component add a folder to /registry/custom
- Add a config.json for it
- Do NOT modify registry.json, it's auto generated with a script!
- Do not EVER register a "registry:preview" type, that's dumb
- Automatically fix the imports to match our project (especially if they have ../../../ and other relative directories like ./ etc)
- Make a preview.tsx file 
- Add it to [page.tsx](mdc:app/page.tsx)
