There is no such thing as registry:context. For Context components we still register them as registry:component

Do not manually update [component-types.ts](mdc:lib/component-types.ts) ever, it's auto generated.
Also [registry.json](mdc:registry.json) is auto generated.
Also json files in public/r/ are automatically generated

DO NOT run npm run dev ever, assume the server is always running.
