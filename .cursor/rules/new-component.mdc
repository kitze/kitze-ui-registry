- When making a new component add a folder to /registry/new-york like /registry/new-york/component-name and the component inside like ComponentName.tsx
- Add a config.ts to it with ComponentConfig type (import { ComponentConfig } from "@/lib/component-config-types";)
- Do NOT modify registry.json, it's auto generated with a script!!
- Do not modify the public/r folder it's auto generated
- Do not EVER register a "registry:preview" type, that's dumb
- Automatically fix the imports to match our project (especially if they have ../../../ and other relative directories like ./ etc)
- Make a preview.tsx file for the component
- Add the preview to [app-sidebar.tsx](mdc:components/app-sidebar.tsx) afterwards
